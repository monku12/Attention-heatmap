# Attention-heatmap
Within this repository, you'll find visualizations depicting the attention weights assigned to individual words in a sentence. The distribution of these attention weights is task-dependent, and in this case, the accompanying Jupyter notebook has been specifically trained for sentiment analysis. Consequently, it illustrates the distribution of attention weights essential for sentiment analysis, with training performed on the [sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140).
